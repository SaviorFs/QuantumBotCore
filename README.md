# QuantumBotCore

QuantumBotCore is a project designed to manage user sessions, add messages, and log events using Firebase Cloud Functions. It incorporates Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure session handling.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- Firebase CLI installed
- Firebase project created

### Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SaviorFs/QuantumBotCore.git
    cd QuantumBotCore
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd functions
    npm install
    ```

3. Set your Firebase project:
    ```bash
    firebase use --add
    ```

4. Set the JWT secret:
    ```bash
    firebase functions:config:set jwt.secret="your_generated_jwt_secret"
    ```

5. Initialize Firebase Admin SDK in `functions/index.js`:
    ```javascript
    const admin = require("firebase-admin");

    if (!admin.apps.length) {
        admin.initializeApp({
            credential: admin.credential.applicationDefault(),
            databaseURL: "https://<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>.firebaseio.com"  // Replace with your actual database URL
        });
    }

    module.exports = admin;
    ```

## Deployment
